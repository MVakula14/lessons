      <div class="section-content-1">
        <div class="content-1-text">
          <p>All of Ukraine is divided into conditional sectors, which are included in the area of ​​responsibility of certain regional air defense units. There are about ten of them.</p>
          <p>That is , a specific military unit of the Air Defense Forces is responsible for the airspace in its own and neighboring regions. A kind of "umbrella" is created over the territory.
          </p>
          <p>Usually, the most protected are the territories where particularly important strategic objects, critical infrastructure, and densely populated cities are located. It is not a military secret that air defense complexes constantly guard the skies over the Boryspil airport, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, or the dam on the Dnieper.</p>
          <p>In wartime , the complexes are not in  one place so as not to come under enemy fire. In the event of an air alarm, they are able to take position and intercept the target in the shortest possible time.</p>
          <p>The time for full combat deployment is less than five minutes. As soon as a sign appears on the radar about the crossing of Ukrainian airspace by enemy planes or missiles , the signal is transmitted to local administrations, which further notify citizens by turning on sirens . 
          </p>
          <p>They often talk about air defense and missile defense . What is the difference ? To put it very simply, anti-missile defense (ABD) is a component of the air defense system for the protection of the country's airspace.</p>
          <p>Air defense includes combating all targets that violate a country's airspace, while missile defense is specifically aimed at protecting against ballistic missiles, including those that carry a nuclear warhead. </p>

        <div class="content-2-text">
          <p>Despite its moral obsolescence, the arsenal of Ukrainian air defense forces is one of the most powerful in Europe. For comparison : the western neighbors actually do not have their own air defense systems, these tasks are performed by the integrated NATO air defense system.</p>
          <p>The Soviet anti-aircraft systems inherited from the Warsaw Pact Organization can not be integrated into this system. Therefore, from a practical point of view, their transfer to Ukraine is more expedient than storing them in hangars. In addition, due to its geographical location, Ukraine potentially protects the skies of Western Europe.</p>
          <p>It is known from open sources that the armed forces of the Armed Forces had Buk-M1, S-125 and S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems (SAMS), as well as their modernization .</p>
        </div>

          <img width="700" src="img/02.jpeg" alt="Buk-M1">
          <h3>Buk-M1</h3>
          <p>In 2013, the completely outdated S-200 air defense system was withdrawn from service, but in 2018 they began to return it for modernization and delivery to combat duty. As of the beginning of 2022, nothing is known about the transfer of S-200 complexes to the Armed Forces.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-2-example example-2">
          <img width="700" src="img/03.jpeg" alt="C-125">
          <h3>C-125</h3>
          <p>Each of these complexes is of "Soviet origin" and was developed in the 1960s and 1980s . But most air defense systems have undergone a number of modernizations already in independent Ukraine, so the peculiarities of their operation are unknown to the Russian aggressors.</p>

        <h2>A little math</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="section-content-3">
        <div class="content-3-text">
          <p>If we talk about air defense "umbrellas", then the S-300 air defense system has the largest range — it is capable of hitting targets at a range of 75 km and an altitude of up to 27,000 . meters </p>
          <p>The S-125 indicators are somewhat more modest — a range of up to 40 km at an altitude of up to 25 thousand . meters For Buk-M1 - up to 32 km at an altitude of up to 18 thousand . meters </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-3-example example-3">
          <img src="img/04.jpeg" alt="S-300" width="700">
          <h3>S-300</h3>
          <p>Note that depending on modernization , these indicators change in the direction of increase.</p>
          <p>Features of the S-300 operation allow you to place them even between houses. After the shot , the rocket rises strictly vertically , to a height of more than 20 meters, and already there the starting engine starts, which sets its course.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-3-text">
          <p>It is known from open sources that at the beginning of 2022, the Ukrainian army had about 35 air defense divisions.</p>
          <p>One division includes from two to four batteries and a control and radar station. One battery consists of three SAMs with 4 launchers each. That is, the battery is capable of firing 12 missiles at once, and the next one takes less than 5 seconds.</p>
          <p>Therefore, when a series of volleys is heard during an air alert, it can be said with high probability that it is an anti-aircraft missile. In the night sky, a downed enemy missile can be seen in the form of a salute with an inverted orientation , that is , not from below to the mountain , but , on the contrary , from the mountain down.</p>
          <p>Su-27 and MiG-29 fighters can also intercept enemy missiles. What , in fact , they did in the first days of the Russian invasion of 2022.</p>

      <div class="section-content-4">
        <div class="content-4-text">
          <p>Considering the number of air alerts that are announced every day, the Ukrainian air defense forces perform their tasks better than perfectly.  Enemy propaganda reports that Russia has already destroyed our air defenses, but for some reason its planes have stopped flying into the territory of Ukraine.</p>
          <p>An old diplomatic saying says that after the signing of a peace treaty , preparations for a new war begin. Therefore, the only guarantee that Russia will not continue missile attacks is their complete ban for the aggressor. Or the disappearance of the Russian Federation as a part of the landmass — the ocean in its place, as in the famous meme.</p>
          <p>However, both options look fantastic today, so you need to think about air defense and anti-missile defense in the post-war period. The best practical application experience is demonstrated by the Israeli Iron Dome system . It was developed by the Rafael Defense Industries company with the participation of American specialists.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-4-example example-4">
          <img src="img/05.jpg" alt="Iron Dome" width="700">
          <h3>Iron Dome</h3>
          <p>ron Dome's interception percentage is more than 95%. At the end of 2021, Ukraine made a request to purchase these systems, but the Israeli authorities refused. According to official information , it is due to the reluctance of confrontation in the Russian Federation and provocation of war in Europe.</p>
          <p>Currently , the US Congress has simplified the possibility of transferring air defense and missile defense systems, including Iron Dome, to Ukraine.</p>

        <p>In March 2022, parliamentarians of a number of countries signed a joint statement on the urgent need to modernize Ukraine's air defense. These are representatives of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Poland, France, Georgia, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Sweden, Great Britain, and the USA.</p>
